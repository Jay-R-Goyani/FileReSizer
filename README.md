# FileReSizer

**FileReSizer** is a powerful and efficient C++ tool designed for file compression and decompression. It supports multiple algorithms for compressing text files, allowing users to choose the best option for their needs. Whether you need to save space, reduce transmission time, or simply manage your data more effectively, FileReSizer provides a reliable solution.


## Features

- **Compress Text Files Using Two Different Algorithms**: Choose between two different compression algorithms to suit your needs.

- **Decompress Those Text Files**: Restore compressed text files to their original state.

- **Shows Ratio Of Compression**: Display the compression ratio to understand the efficiency of the compression process.

- **Support for Various File Types**: Works with different file formats.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy usage.
## Usage
1. **Include Header Files and Main File**:
    Make sure you have the following files saved in the project directory:
    - `Unit_Huffman.hpp`: Header file for the first compression algorithm
    - `Unit_LZW.hpp`: Header file for the second compression algorithm
    - `FileReSizer.cpp`: Main file to run the program

2. **Compile And Run**: 
        Now Execute FileReSizer.cpp file.
  After that, you will see three options: compressing, decompressing, and exiting.
  In the compressing and decompressing options, there are two additional choices: Huffman and Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithms.
  When compressing or decompressing files, you can specify the file path or (for same directory) name for the chosen option.
